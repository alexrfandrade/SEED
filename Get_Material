For this experiment, we use images from the ObScene database. 
The excels contain the name of the selected images. 
To access the stimuli, you can download all images from the ObScene dataset at https://osf.io/4pqsu/overview?view_only=9478429999754bd1afc3823c4876de18 
Once downloaded, it suffces to change the names of the folders (i.e.Scenes_Dataset and Objects_Dataset) and move them to the same folder as the psyexp file.
